Just spot-check some few 10s of examples (let's hope for 80% or some examples)
They can even recruit some people who are experts
- They have some in-house annotators, but for things liek coding they have external annotators.
- It might be nice to use human review to find the good exemplars from the auto-generated ones


Re: distribution of selected perturbation types
- It might be due to 

For the questions we already have, do we have some 

The types of questions in this dataset might not be that diverse.
We can look through it and choose the perturbation types that are intuitively applicable to the dataset (but note that we're using the CNK12 subset for now)


Re: Creating multiple perturbations from a single example (type, position)
- For now, we do the peturbation and truncation
- Ask the model to choose somewhere critical in the solution and apply the perturbation there
- Maybe try this with 5-10 and see if it's obviously good at doing this.

IF you maybe ask the moel to do some reasoning before the choice.

Should I use Temperature 0 for the ?
> I think so, yes. It limits us to generating 1 example 
> Post a sidebyside of 0, .3, and a few .6s


GPT4omini and Sonnet 3.5 and Newest Cohere

For the verification of recovery and getting the right answer
- Maybe in the prompt structure, we can explicitly require the model to put the answer in some sort of <answer> tag
- Leave that for later
