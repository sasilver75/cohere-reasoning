1,"Given the functions $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$.
1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.","Step 1: Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain restrictions for both $\log_a(1+x)$ and $\log_a(1-x)$ to be defined.

Step 2: This gives us the system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 3: Solving this system, we find that $-1 < x < 1$, which indicates that the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is indeed $(-1, 1)$.

Step 4: Now, let's consider the symmetry of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ about the origin. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, we can define a new function $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. 

Step 5: Evaluating $F(-x)$, we get $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. This shows that $F(x)$ is an odd function, and consequently, $f(x) - g(x)$ is also an odd function.

Step 6: Next, we focus on the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, which is equivalent to $f(x) > g(x)$. This implies that $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. 

Step 7: For the case where $a > 1$, we have the following system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$

Step 8: Simplifying the system, we get:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 9: Solving this simplified system, we find that $0 < x < 1$. 

Step 10: On the other hand, if $0 < a < 1$, the system of inequalities becomes:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$

Step 11: Simplifying this system, we have:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 12: Solving the simplified system, we obtain $-1 < x < 0$. 

Step 13: In summary, for $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $(0, 1)$, and for $0 < a < 1$, the solution set is $(-1, 0)$.

Step 14: Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ when $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ when $0 < a < 1$.","Step 1: Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain restrictions for both $\log_a(1+x)$ and $\log_a(1-x)$ to be defined.

Step 2: This gives us the system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1+x > 0

$$",2,Dropped negative sign,"The second inequality should be $1-x > 0$, but the negative sign was dropped, resulting in $1+x > 0$.","
Step 3: Solving the first inequality, we get $x > -1$. Solving the second inequality, we get $x < 1$. Therefore, the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{-1 < x < 1}$.

<answer>The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $-1 < x < 1$.</answer>

Step 4: To determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$, we can examine the behavior of the function when $x$ is positive and when $x$ is negative.

Step 5: When $x$ is positive, $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x) > 0$ because $\log_a(1+x)$ is positive and $\log_a(1-x)$ is negative.

Step 6: When $x$ is negative, $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x) < 0$ because $\log_a(1+x)$ is negative and $\log_a(1-x)$ is positive.

Step 7: Therefore, the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is not even or odd.

<answer>The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is neither even nor odd.</answer>

Step 8: To find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we can consider the behavior of the function within its domain.

2,"In $\triangle ABC$, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Given that $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$ and $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$, find the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$.","Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Using the cosine law, we have $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ can be written as

$a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain $c = 2$.

Now, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality holds when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

Using the sine law, we have $\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9}$.

The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.","Step 1: Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine law, we can write $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ as $a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$.

Step 3: Simplifying the equation yields $c = 2$.

Step 4: From the given information, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality is achieved when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

Step 5: Applying the sine law, we find $\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9}$.

Step 6: The area of $\triangle ABC$ is calculated as $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine law, we can write $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ as $a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} - b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$.",2,Arithmetic sign error,The sign in the second term of the equation in Step 2 was changed from a plus to a minus.,"
Step 3: Simplifying the equation in Step 2, we get $a^3 - a^2b - ab^2 - b^3 + b^2c + bc^2 = 36ac$.

Step 4: Note that $a^3 - a^2b - ab^2 - b^3 + b^2c + bc^2 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) + b(c^2 - b^2) = (a+b)(a - b)^2 + b(c-b)(c+b)$.

Step 5: Substituting $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ into Heron's formula, we get the area of $\triangle ABC$ as $S = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$.

Step 6: To maximize $S$, we can use Lagrange multipliers with the constraint $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$. The Lagrangian function is $L(a, b, c, \lambda) = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) - \lambda(a \cos B + b \cos A - 2)$.

Step 7: The critical points of $L$ satisfy $\nabla L = 0$, which leads to a system of equations:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial a} &= (s-a)(s-b)(s-c) - \lambda \left(\frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} - \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right) = 0 \\

\frac{\partial L}{\partial c} &= (s-a)(s-b)(s-c) - \lambda \left(\frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} - \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}\right) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} &= a \cos B + b \cos A - 2 = 0
\end{align*}

Step 8: Solving the system of equations, we find that one of the solutions is $a = b = \frac{9}{2}, c = \frac{3}{2}, \lambda = -\frac{27}{4}$.

Step 9: Plugging the values of $a, b, c$ into the area formula, we get the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ as $S = \sqrt{\frac{27}{8} \cdot \frac{19}{8} \cdot \frac{19}{8} \cdot \frac{5}{8}} = \frac{9 \sqrt{19}}{16}$.

<answer>Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{9 \sqrt{19}}{16}}$.</answer>"

A: $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) \lt x_{2}+f(x_{2})$

B: $x_{2}f(x_{1}) \lt x_{1}f(x_{2})$

D: If the equation $f\left(x\right)=a$ has a root, then $a=-\frac{1}{e}$","To analyze each option step by step, we start with the given function $f(x)=x\ln x$ and the condition $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$.

**Option A:**

1. Define $g(x)=f(x)+x=x\ln x+x$.
2. Calculate the derivative: $g'(x)=\ln x + 2$.
3. Analyze $g'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 < 0$, so $g(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 > 0$, so $g(x)$ is increasing.
4. Conclusion for option A:
   - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$. Thus, option A is $\boxed{\text{incorrect}}$.

**Option B:**

1. Consider the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.
2. Since $\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.
3. Therefore, $\frac{f(x_{1})}{x_{1}} < \frac{f(x_{2})}{x_{2}}$, which implies $x_{2}f(x_{1}) < x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option B is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

**Option C:**

1. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=\ln x + 1$.
2. Analyze $f'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) < 0$, so $f(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) > 0$, so $f(x)$ is increasing.
3. For ${x_2} > {x_1} > \frac{1}{e}$, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.
4. This leads to $(x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{1}) > (x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{2})$, which simplifies to $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option C is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

**Option D:**

1. Consider the case when $a=0$, the equation $f(x)=0$ has a solution at $x=1$.

Step 8: 4. Conclusion for option A:

Step 9: - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$. Thus, option A is $\boxed{\text{incorrect}}$.

Step 10: **Option B:**

Step 11: 1. Consider the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.

Step 12: 2. Since $\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.

3. Since $x_{1} < x_{2}$, and $g'(x)=2\ln x+1$ is an increasing function when $x > \frac{1}{e}$, we have $g(x_{1}) < g(x_{2})$, that is, $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) < x_{2}+f(x_{2})$.

Step 4: **Option B:**

Step 5: 1. Consider the function $h(x)=\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.
2. Since $h(x)$ is an increasing function when $x > \frac{1}{e}$, we have $h(x_{1}) < h(x_{2})$, that is, $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.
3. Multiplying both sides by $x_{1}x_{2}$, we get $x_{1}f(x_{2}) < x_{2}f(x_{1})$.

Step 6: **Option C:**

Step 7: 1. We have $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$ if and only if $x_{1}f(x_{1})-x_{1}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})-x_{2}f(x_{2})$.
2. Let $k(x)=f(x)\ln x=x(\ln x)^{2}$.
3. Then $k'(x)=(\ln x)^{2}+2\ln x=0$ when $x=1$ or $x=\frac{1}{e}$.
4. Since $k''(x)=\frac{2}{x}+4\ln x > 0$ when $x > \frac{1}{e}$, $k(x)$ is a strictly increasing function when $x > \frac{1}{e}$.
5. Therefore, when $x_{2} > x_{1} > \frac{1}{e}$, we have $k(x_{1}) < k(x_{2})$, that is, $x_{1}f(x_{1}) < x_{2}f(x_{2})$.
6. Hence, $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$.

Step 8: **Option D:**

Step 9: 1. The equation $f(x)=a$ can be rewritten as $x\ln x=a$.
2. Let $x=e^{y}$, then the equation becomes $e^{y}\cdot y=a$.
3. It is obvious that $a=0$ is a root.
4. When $a \neq 0$, let $y=a\cdot z$, then the equation becomes $e^{az} \cdot az=a$, that is, $e^{az} \cdot z=1$.
5. It is known that $e^{z} \cdot z \geq 1$ for any $z$, and the equality holds if and only if $z=0$.
6. Therefore, $e^{az} \cdot z \geq 1$ for any $z$, and the equality holds if and only if $z=0$.
7. Hence, the equation $e^{az} \cdot z=1$ has no roots when $a \neq 0$.

From the pattern, we observe that the coefficient of $a$ in the first equation is $1$. The left side of the equation simplifies to $1+4-9=-4$. Therefore, we have:

$-4 = 1 \times a - b$

Given that $b$ is a constant across all equations, we can deduce the value of $a$ by comparing the structure of the equations. The first part of the right side of the equation is the product of the index and the number $2$ less than the index. Thus, for the first equation, it should be $1 \times (-1) = -1$. Hence,

$a = -1$

Step 22: #### Part 2: Conjecture for the $n$th Equation

Step 23: **Conjecture:**

Step 24: For the $n$th equation in the sequence, the pattern suggests that the equation will be of the form:

Step 25: $$(n-1)^2 + n^2 - (n+1)^2 = n \times (n-2) - 11$$

Step 26: **Proof:**

Step 27: We will prove this conjecture by mathematical induction on $n$.

Step 28: **Base Case ($n=1$):**

Step 29: For $n=1$, the equation becomes:

Step 30: $0^2 + 1^2 - 2^2 = 1 \times (-2) - 11$

Step 31: Simplifying both sides:

Step 32: $1-4=-11$

Step 33: $-3=-3$

Step 34: The base case holds true.

Step 35: **Induction Hypothesis:**

Step 36: Assume that the conjecture is true for $n=k$, i.e.,

Step 37: $$(k-1)^2 + k^2 - (k+1)^2 = k \times (k-2) - 11$$

Step 38: **Induction Step ($n=k+1$):**

Step 39: Now, we need to prove that the conjecture holds for $n=k+1$. So, consider the $(k+1)$th equation:

Step 40: $$[k^2 + (k+1)^2 - (k+2)^2] = (k+1) \times (k-1) - 11$$

Step 41: Expanding the left-hand side (LHS):

Step 42: $$k^2 + (k+1)^2 - [k^2 + 4k + 4] = (k+1)k - 11$$

Step 43: Simplifying further:

Step 44: $$2k^2 + 2k - 4 = k^2 + k - 11$$

Step 45: Rearranging the terms:

Step 46: $$k^2 - 3k - 7 = 0$$

Step 47: Factoring the above quadratic equation:

Step 48: $$(k-7)(k+1)=0$$

Step 49: We already know that $k \neq -1$ (from the base case), so we must have $k=7$.

Step 50: Now, we can substitute $k=7$ into the equation from the induction hypothesis:

Step 51: $$(7-1)^2 + 7^2 - (7+1)^2 = 7 \times (7-2) - 11$$

Step 52: Simplifying the equation:

Step 53: $49=49$

Step 54: The equation holds true for $n=k+1$.

Step 55: Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the conjecture is proven for all positive integer values of $n$.

2. The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. To find the number of sides (n) of the polygon, we use the formula for the sum of exterior angles: $n \times \text{exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}$. Substituting the exterior angle we found:

\[n = \frac{360^{\circ}}{36^{\circ}} = 10\]

Therefore, the number of sides of this regular polygon is $\boxed{10}$, which corresponds to choice $\boxed{B}$.","Step 1: Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, we can find the number of sides of this polygon by following these steps:

Step 2: Calculate the exterior angle of the polygon. The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the exterior angle is $180^{\circ} - 144^{\circ} = 36^{\circ}$.

Step 3: The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. To find the number of sides (n) of the polygon, we use the formula for the sum of exterior angles: $n \times \text{exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}$. Substituting the exterior angle we found:

\[n = \frac{360^{\circ}}{36^{\circ}} = 10\]

Step 2: Calculate the exterior angle of the polygon. The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the exterior angle is $180^{\circ} + 144^{\circ} = 324^{\circ}$.",2,Arithmetic sign error,"The arithmetic sign error was introduced in Step 2 by using the wrong operation. Instead of subtracting the interior angle from $180^{\circ}$ to find the exterior angle, the interior angle was incorrectly added, resulting in an exterior angle of $324^{\circ}$.","
Step 3: The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. So, we can set up the equation:

$$324^{\circ} \cdot \text{number of sides} = 360^{\circ}$$

Step 4: Solving for the number of sides, we get:

$$\text{number of sides} = \frac{360^{\circ}}{324^{\circ}} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot 6 = \boxed{5}$$
