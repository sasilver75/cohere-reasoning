1,"Given the functions $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$.
1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.","Step 1: Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain restrictions for both $\log_a(1+x)$ and $\log_a(1-x)$ to be defined.

Step 2: This gives us the system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 3: Solving this system, we find that $-1 < x < 1$, which indicates that the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is indeed $(-1, 1)$.

Step 4: Now, let's consider the symmetry of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ about the origin. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, we can define a new function $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. 

Step 5: Evaluating $F(-x)$, we get $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. This shows that $F(x)$ is an odd function, and consequently, $f(x) - g(x)$ is also an odd function.

Step 6: Next, we focus on the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, which is equivalent to $f(x) > g(x)$. This implies that $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. 

Step 7: For the case where $a > 1$, we have the following system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$

Step 8: Simplifying the system, we get:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 9: Solving this simplified system, we find that $0 < x < 1$. 

Step 10: On the other hand, if $0 < a < 1$, the system of inequalities becomes:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$

Step 11: Simplifying this system, we have:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Step 12: Solving the simplified system, we obtain $-1 < x < 0$. 

Step 13: In summary, for $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $(0, 1)$, and for $0 < a < 1$, the solution set is $(-1, 0)$.

Step 14: Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ when $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ when $0 < a < 1$.","Step 1: Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain restrictions for both $\log_a(1+x)$ and $\log_a(1-x)$ to be defined.

Step 2: This gives us the system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1+x > 0
\end{cases}
$$",2,Dropped negative sign,"The second inequality should be $1-x > 0$, but the negative sign was dropped, resulting in $1+x > 0$.","
Step 3: Solving the first inequality, we get $x > -1$. Similarly, solving the second inequality, we find $x < 1$. Therefore, the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is the intersection of these two intervals:

<answer>$x \in (-1, 1)$</answer>

Step 4: Now, let's determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$. Parity refers to whether a function is even or odd. An even function satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$, while an odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$.

Step 5: Let's evaluate $f(-x) - g(-x)$:
$$
f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x)
$$

Step 6: We can see that $f(-x) - g(-x) = -(f(x) - g(x))$. This means that the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is <answer>odd</answer>.

Step 7: Finally, let's find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. We have:
$$
\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x) > 0
$$

Step 8: Using the properties of logarithms, we can combine the logarithms into a single logarithm:
$$
\log_a \left( \frac{1+x}{1-x} \right) > 0
$$

Step 9: For the logarithm to be positive, the argument must be greater than 1:
$$
\frac{1+x}{1-x} > 1
$$

Step 10: Simplifying the inequality, we get:
$$
1+x > 1-x \implies x > 0
$$

So, the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is <answer>$(0, 1)$</answer>."
2,"In $\triangle ABC$, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Given that $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$ and $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$, find the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$.","Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Using the cosine law, we have $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ can be written as

$a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain $c = 2$.

Now, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality holds when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

Using the sine law, we have $\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9}$.

The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.","Step 1: Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine law, we can write $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ as $a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$.

Step 3: Simplifying the equation yields $c = 2$.

Step 4: From the given information, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality is achieved when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

Step 5: Applying the sine law, we find $\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9}$.

Step 6: The area of $\triangle ABC$ is calculated as $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.

Step 7: Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.","Step 1: Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine law, we can write $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ as $a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} - b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$.",2,Arithmetic sign error,The sign in the second term of the equation in Step 2 was changed from a plus to a minus.,"
Step 3: Simplifying the equation in Step 2, we get $a^3 - a^2b - ab^2 - b^3 = 36c$.

Step 4: Note that $36c = 36\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C} = 36\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab(1/9)} = 12\sqrt{81a^2 + 81b^2 - 18ab}$.

Step 5: Let $x = a + b$ and $y = a - b$. Then, $a = \frac{x + y}{2}$ and $b = \frac{x - y}{2}$.

Step 6: Substituting $a$ and $b$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ into the equation from Step 3, we get $\left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2\left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)^3 = 12\sqrt{81\left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 + 81\left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)^2 - 18\left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)}$.

Step 7: Simplifying the equation in Step 6, we get $2x^3 - 3xy^2 = 108\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 2xy}$.

Step 8: Squaring both sides, we get $4x^6 - 9x^2y^2 = 11664(x^2 + y^2 + 2xy)$.

Step 9: Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^4 - 1296x^2 - 1296y^2 = 0$.

Step 10: Let $z = x^2$. Then, $z^2 - 1296z - 1296y^2 = 0$.

Step 11: This quadratic equation has two solutions for $z$: $z = 72^2$ and $z = -108y^2$.

Step 12: If $z = 72^2$, then $x^2 = 5184$, which gives $x = \pm 72$. However, $x = a + b$ must be positive, so $x = 72$.

Step 13: If $z = -108y^2$, then $x^2 = 108y^2$, which gives $x = \pm 108y$.

Step 14: We can eliminate the case where $x = -108y$ because it would imply that $a$ and $b$ have different signs, which is not possible for the sides of a triangle.

Step 15: So, we have $x = 108y$. Substituting back, we get $a + b = 108\sqrt{a^2 - ab + b^2}$.

Step 16: Squaring both sides, we get $(a + b)^2 = 11664(a^2 - ab + b^2)$.

Step 17: Expanding and simplifying, we get $a^4 - 1296a^2b^2 + b^4 = 0$.

Step 18: Again, let's substitute $a$ and $b$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

Step 19: This gives us $\left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^4 - 1296\left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2\left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x - y}{2}\right)^4 = 0$.

Step 20: Simplifying, we get $x^4 - 648x^2y^2 + y^4 = 0$.

Step 21: Dividing by $y^4$, we get $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^4 - 648\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 + 1 = 0$.

Step 22: Let $w = \frac{x}{y}$. Then, $w^4 - 648w^2 + 1 = 0$.

Step 23: This quartic equation has four solutions for $w$: $w = \pm 6\sqrt{3} \pm 6$.

Step 24: We can eliminate the cases where $w < 0$ because it would imply that $a$ or $b$ is negative.

Step 25: So, we have $w_1 = 6\sqrt{3} + 6$ and $w_2 = 6\sqrt{3} - 6$.

Step 26: Now, we can find $x$ and $y$ by multiplying by $y$: $x_1 = (6\sqrt{3} + 6)y$ and $x_2 = (6\sqrt{3} - 6)y$.

Step 27: We already found that $x = 72$ in Step 12, so $72 = (6\sqrt{3} + 6)y$ or $72 = (6\sqrt{3} - 6)y$.

Step 28: Solving for $y$, we find $y = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} + 1}$ or $y = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$.

Step 29: Since $y$ represents the difference between $a$ and $b$, we take the positive value: $y = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$.

Step 30: Now, we can find the values of $a$ and $b$. From $x = a + b = 72$, we get $a + b = 72$. Substituting $y = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$, we get $a - b = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$. Solving this system of equations, we find $a = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$ and $b = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3} + 1}$.

Step 31: Finally, we can calculate the area of $\triangle ABC$ using Heron's formula: $[\triangle ABC] = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$.

Step 32: We have $a = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$, $b = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3} + 1}$, and $c$ can be calculated using the cosine law: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C = \left(\frac{36}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{36}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{36}{\sqrt{3} - 1}\right)\left(\frac{36}{\sqrt{3} + 1}\right)\left(\frac{1}{9}\right) = 1296$. So, $c = 36$.

Step 33: Plugging these values into Heron's formula, we get $[\triangle ABC] = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{\frac{(a+b+c)}{2}\left(\frac{a+b-c}{2}\right)\left(\frac{-a+b+c}{2}\right)\left(\frac{-a+b-c}{2}\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{72+36}{2}\left(\frac{72-36}{2}\right)\left(\frac{36-36}{2}\right)\left(\frac{-36-36}{2}\right)} = \sqrt{54\cdot 18 \cdot 0 \cdot (-36)} = \sqrt{0} = <answer>0</answer>$.

The maximum area of the triangle is 0, which means that the triangle degenerates to a line, and no triangle with the given conditions has a positive area."

Step 2: Observing the expression, we see that each term has at least one factor of $x$. Thus, we can factor out $x^2$ from the expression:

\[
x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x^2(x-6+9).
\]",2,Algebraic manipulation error,The perturbation was applied by incorrectly factoring out $x^2$ instead of $x$ from the expression in Step 2. This mistake alters the subsequent steps and the final answer.,"
Step 3: Now, we focus on the expression inside the parentheses, $x-6+9$. Here, we can factor out a $3$ from the constant terms:

\[
x-6+9 = x-2(3)+3(3) = x-2\cdot3+3^2.
\]

Step 4: Recognizing the pattern of a perfect square trinomial, we can further factor the expression as:

\[
x-2\cdot3+3^2 = (x-2\cdot3+3)(x-2\cdot3+3) = (x-3)^2.
\]

Step 5: Substituting this back into our original expression, we get:

\[
x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x^2(x-6+9) = x^2(x-3)^2.
\]

So, the final factorized form is:

D: If the equation $f\left(x\right)=a$ has a root, then $a=-\frac{1}{e}$","To analyze each option step by step, we start with the given function $f(x)=x\ln x$ and the condition $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$.

**Option A:**

1. Define $g(x)=f(x)+x=x\ln x+x$.
2. Calculate the derivative: $g'(x)=\ln x + 2$.
3. Analyze $g'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 < 0$, so $g(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 > 0$, so $g(x)$ is increasing.
4. Conclusion for option A:
   - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$. Thus, option A is $\boxed{\text{incorrect}}$.

**Option B:**

1. Consider the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.
2. Since $\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.
3. Therefore, $\frac{f(x_{1})}{x_{1}} < \frac{f(x_{2})}{x_{2}}$, which implies $x_{2}f(x_{1}) < x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option B is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

**Option C:**

1. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=\ln x + 1$.
2. Analyze $f'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) < 0$, so $f(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) > 0$, so $f(x)$ is increasing.
3. For ${x_2} > {x_1} > \frac{1}{e}$, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.
4. This leads to $(x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{1}) > (x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{2})$, which simplifies to $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option C is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

Step 4: 2. Calculate the derivative: $g'(x)=\ln x + 2$.

Step 5: 3. Analyze $g'(x)$:

Step 8: 4. Conclusion for option A:

Step 9: - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$. Thus, option A is $\boxed{\text{incorrect}}$.

Step 10: **Option B:**

Step 11: 1. Consider the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.

Step 12: 2. Since $\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.

Step 19: 3. For ${x_2} > {x_1} > \frac{1}{e}$, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.

3. Since $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0,+\infty)$, we have $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) < x_{2}+f(x_{2})$.

Step 4: **Option B:**

Step 5: 1. Since $f(x)=x\ln x$ is strictly increasing on $(0,1)$ and strictly decreasing on $(1,+\infty)$, and $x_{1} < x_{2}$, we have $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.
2. Multiply both sides by $x_{2}$, we get $x_{2}f(x_{1}) < x_{2}f(x_{2})$.
3. Since $f(x_{2}) < 0$ for $x_{2} > 1$, we have $x_{2}f(x_{1}) < x_{2}f(x_{2}) < 0$.
4. Multiply both sides by $-1$, we get $0 < x_{2}f(x_{2}) < x_{2}f(x_{1})$.

Step 6: **Option C:**

Step 7: 1. Calculate the derivative of $f(x)$, we get $f'(x)=\ln x+1$.
2. Set $f'(x)=0$, we get $x=e^{-1}$.
3. So, $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0,e^{-1})$ and strictly decreasing on $(e^{-1},+\infty)$.
4. When $x_{2} > x_{1} > e^{-1}$, we have $f(x_{1}) > f(x_{2})$.
5. Multiply $f(x_{1})$ by $x_{1}$ and $f(x_{2})$ by $x_{2}$, we get $x_{1}f(x_{1}) > x_{2}f(x_{2})$.
6. Add $x_{2}f(x_{1})$ to both sides, we get $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2})$.
7. Since $f(x_{2}) < 0$, we have $x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) < x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$.

Step 8: **Option D:**

Step 9: 1. The equation $f(x)=a$ can be written as $x\ln x=a$.
2. Let $y=x\ln x$, then $x=e^{\frac{y}{a}}$.
3. Substitute $x$ into the equation, we get $e^{\frac{y}{a}}\cdot\frac{y}{a}=a$, which is equivalent to $y=a^2e^{-\frac{y}{a}}$.
4. Define $h(y)=y-a^2e^{-\frac{y}{a}}$, then $h'(y)=1+\frac{y}{a}e^{-\frac{y}{a}}-\frac{a}{a}e^{-\frac{y}{a}}=1+\left(1-a\right)e^{-\frac{y}{a}}$.
5. When $a < 1$, we have $h'(y) > 0$, which means $h(y)$ is strictly increasing on $(-\infty,+\infty)$.
6. When $a=1$, we have $h(y)=y-e^{-y}$, and $h'(y)=1-e^{-y} < 0$ for $y < 0$, $h'(y)=0$ for $y=0$, and $h'(y) > 0$ for $y > 0$.
7. So, $h(y)$ is strictly decreasing on $(-\infty,0]$ and strictly increasing on $[0,+\infty)$.
8. When $a > 1$, we have $h'(y) < 0$, which means $h(y)$ is strictly decreasing on $(-\infty,+\infty)$.
9. Therefore, the equation $f(x)=a$ has a root if and only if $a < 1$.
10. When $a < 1$, the equation $h(y)=0$ has a unique root, denoted as $y_0$.
11. Since $h(0)=0$, we have $y_0=0$.
12. So, the equation $f(x)=a$ has a unique root $x_0=e^{\frac{y_0}{a}}=e^0=1$.

Step 10: In summary, option A and C are correct.

Step 9: From the first equation, we can see that $a=1$ and $b=0$. This is because $1^2 + 2^2 - 3^2 = 1$, and the right-hand side simplifies to $1 \times a - 0$.

Step 10: #### Part 2: Conjecturing the $n$th Equation

Step 11: **Conjecture for the $n$th equation:**

Step 12: Based on the pattern observed in the given equations, the $n$th equation can be conjectured as:

Step 13: $$

Step 14: n^{2}+(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2}=n\times(n-1)-b.

Step 15: $$

Step 16: **Proof:**

Step 17: We will prove this conjecture by mathematical induction:

Step 18: **Base Case ($n=1$):**

Step 19: For $n=1$, the equation becomes:

Step 20: $$

1^{2}+2^{2}-3^{2}=1\times(1-1)-b,

Step 21: $$

Step 22: which simplifies to $1=0-b$, or $b=0$. This matches the pattern we found in Part 1.

Step 23: **Inductive Step:**

Step 24: Assume the conjecture is true for $n=k$, i.e.,

Step 25: $$

Step 26: k^{2}+(k+1)^{2}-(k+2)^{2}=k\times(k-1)-b.

Step 27: $$

Step 28: Now, we need to prove that the conjecture holds for $n=k+1$. The $(k+1)$th equation is:

Step 29: $$

Step 30: (k+1)^{2}+(k+2)^{2}-(k+3)^{2}=(k+1)\times(k+1-1)-b.

Step 31: $$

Step 32: Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

Step 33: $$

Step 34: (k+1)^{2}+(k+2)^{2}-(k+3)^{2}=k^2 + 2k + 1 + k^2 + 4k + 4 - (k^2 + 6k + 9).

Step 35: $$

Step 36: Combining like terms, it simplifies to:

Step 37: $$

Step 38: 2k^2 + 4 = k(k+1)-b.

Step 39: $$

Step 40: Now, we can substitute the value of $b$ from the $k$th equation (assumed in the inductive step) to get:

Step 41: $$

2k^2 + 4 = k(k+1)-k(k-1) = k^2 + k.

Step 42: $$

Step 43: This is a true statement, proving that the conjecture holds for $n=k+1$.

Step 44: **Conclusion:**

Step 45: By mathematical induction, we have proven that the conjecture is true for all positive integer values of $n$.

<answer>Therefore, $a = 1$ and $b = 0$, and the $n$th equation is $n^{2}+(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2}=n\times(n-1)-0$.</answer>"

B: $10$

C: $8$

D: $6$","Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, we can find the number of sides of this polygon by following these steps:

1. Calculate the exterior angle of the polygon. The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the exterior angle is $180^{\circ} - 144^{\circ} = 36^{\circ}$.

2. The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. To find the number of sides (n) of the polygon, we use the formula for the sum of exterior angles: $n \times \text{exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}$. Substituting the exterior angle we found:

\[n = \frac{360^{\circ}}{36^{\circ}} = 10\]

Therefore, the number of sides of this regular polygon is $\boxed{10}$, which corresponds to choice $\boxed{B}$.","Step 1: Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, we can find the number of sides of this polygon by following these steps:

Instead of subtracting the interior angle from $180^{\circ}$ to find the exterior angle, the interior angle was incorrectly added, resulting in an exterior angle of $324^{\circ}$.","
Step 3: The sum of all exterior angles in any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. So, we can set up the equation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \text{Number of sides} \cdot \text{Exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}

Step 4: Now, we can plug in the value of the exterior angle from Step 2 and solve for the number of sides:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{Number of sides} \cdot 324^{\circ} &= 360^{\circ} \\

Therefore, the inequality $f(a)+f(a-2) > 6$ is equivalent to $f(a-2) > 6-f(a)$,

Step 2: Therefore, the inequality $f(a)+f(a-2) > 6$ is equivalent to $f(a-2) > 6-f(a)$, which is equivalent to $f(a-2) > f(-a)$.

Step 3: Since $f'(x)=-5x^{4}-9x^{2}-5 < 0$ always holds, $f(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$.

Step 4: Thus, from $f(a-2) > f(-a)$, we get $a-2 < -a$, which means $a < 1$.

Step 5: Therefore, the correct choice is: $\boxed{D}$.

Step 6: By analyzing the function's expression, we find that $f(-x)+f(x)=6$ holds for any $x$. Hence, the original inequality is equivalent to $f(a-2) > f(-a)$.

Step 7: Using the derivative, we prove that $f(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function on $\mathbb{R}$, which leads to the original inequality being equivalent to $a-2 < -a$.

Step 5: If $a > 1$, then $-a < a-2$, and hence $f(-a) < f(a-2)$.

We know that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$. So,
$$
\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\times 4 \times 5 \times \sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
$$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle and $\sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we can deduce that angle $C$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Now, using the cosine law, we can find $c$ (which represents $|AB|$):
$$
c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos C = 16+25-2\times 4 \times 5 \times \frac{1}{2}=21.
$$
Hence, $c = \sqrt{21}$ and $|AB| = \boxed{\sqrt{21}}$.

To solve this problem, we first used the formula for the area of a triangle to find the sine of angle $C$. Then, using the information that the triangle is acute and the value of $\sin C$, we determined that angle $C$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Finally, we applied the cosine law to find the length of side $c$, which represents $|AB|$. This problem tests understanding of the cosine law and the application of the triangle area formula in solving triangles, requiring both computational skills and problem-solving ability.","Step 1: Given: $a=4$, $b=5$, and the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $5 \sqrt {3}$.

Step 2: We know that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$. So,

Step 3: $$
\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\times 4 \times 5 \times \sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.

Step 4: Since $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle and $\sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we can deduce that angle $C$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Now, using the cosine law, we can find $c$ (which represents $|AB|$):

Step 2: We know that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $ab\sin C$. So,",2,Misapplied formula,The formula for the area of a triangle is incorrectly stated as $ab\sin C$ instead of $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$.,"
$$5\sqrt{3} = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot \sin C$$

Step 3: Solving for $\sin C$, we get

$$\sin C = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{4 \cdot 5} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$$

Step 4: Taking the inverse sine of both sides, we find

$$C = \arcsin \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)$$

Step 5: Now, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of $AB$. The Law of Sines states that

$$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$$

Step 6: Substituting the values, we get

$$\frac{4}{\sin A} = \frac{5}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin \left(\arcsin \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\right)}$$

Step 7: Simplifying the rightmost fraction, we have

$$\frac{4}{\sin A} = \frac{5}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{3}/4}$$

Step 8: Multiplying the rightmost fraction by $4/\sqrt{3}$, we get

$$\frac{4}{\sin A} = \frac{5}{\sin B} = \frac{4c}{3}$$

Step 9: Now, we can solve for $c$.

$$c = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{\sin A} = \frac{3}{\sin A}$$

Step 10: Substituting $A = 180^\circ - B - C$, we get

$$c = \frac{3}{\sin (180^\circ - B - C)}$$

Step 11: Using the sine complement formula, $\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x$, we have

$$c = \frac{3}{\sin (B + C)}$$

Step 12: Now, we can use the angle addition formula for sine, $\sin (x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y$.

$$c = \frac{3}{\sin B \cos C + \cos B \sin C}$$

Step 13: Substituting $\sin C = \sqrt{3}/4$ and $\cos C = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 C} = \sqrt{7}/4$, we get

$$c = \frac{3}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} + \cos B \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}$$

Step 14: Simplifying, we have

$$c = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{\sqrt{21} + 4\sqrt{3}\cos B}$$

Step 15: Finally, we can use the Law of Cosines to find $\cos B$. The Law of Cosines states that

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$$

Step 16: Substituting the values, we get

$$c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 - 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot \cos B$$

Step 17: Simplifying and solving for $\cos B$, we find

$$\cos B = \frac{4^2 + 5^2 - c^2}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}$$

Step 18: Substituting $c = 3 \cdot 4^2 / (\sqrt{21} + 4\sqrt{3}\cos B)$, we get

$$\cos B = \frac{16 + 25 - \frac{3 \cdot 256}{(\sqrt{21} + 4\sqrt{3}\cos B)^2}}{40}$$

Step 19: This equation can be solved numerically, yielding $\cos B \approx 0.659$.

Step 20: Now, we can find $c$ by substituting the value of $\cos B$ back into the equation from Step 14.

$$c \approx \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{\sqrt{21} + 4\sqrt{3} \cdot 0.659} \approx 6.928$$

Step 21: Therefore, the length of $|AB|$ is approximately $\boxed{6.928}$.

The equation of the hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ can be rewritten as $\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}- \dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1$.

Since $|PF_{1}|-|PF_{2}|=4$, we have $|PF_{1}|=6$. Therefore, $c= \sqrt {4+4}=2 \sqrt {2}$, which means $c=2 \sqrt {2}$.

By the definition of an ellipse, we have $2a=|PF_{2}|+|PF_{2}|=8$,

Thus, $a=4$.

Since the ellipse $C_{1}: \dfrac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \dfrac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0)$ and the hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ have the same right focus $F_{2}$,

The eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$ is $e= \dfrac {c}{a}= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}}$.

By converting the equation of the hyperbola into its standard form and knowing $|PF_{2}|=2$ and $|PF_{1}|=6$, we can determine $a=4$ and $c=2 \sqrt {2}$, which allows us to find the eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$.

From the given information, we know that $a > b$ and the right focus is $(c, 0)$, where $c$ is the distance from the center of the ellipse to the focus.

Step 4: Using the distance formula, we can find the distance between point $P$ and the focus $F_2$. Let $P$ be $(x_0, y_0)$. Then:

$$|PF_2| = \sqrt{(x_0 - c)^2 + y_0^2}$$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a\_n = 2a\_{n-1} + 1$.

Therefore, $a\_n + 1 = 2(a\_{n-1} + 1)$.

This means that $\frac{a\_n + 1}{a\_{n-1} + 1} = 2$, which is a constant.

Thus, the sequence ${a\_n + 1}$ is a geometric sequence with first term $a\_1 + 1 = 2$ and common ratio $2$.

Hence, $a\_n + 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.

Using the cosine double angle formula, $\cos (2θ)= 2\cos^2(θ) - 1$, we can rewrite $\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α)$ as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α) &= 2\cos^2( \frac {π}{3}-α) - 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{3}\right)^2 - 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{9}\right) - 1 \\
&= \boxed{-\frac {7}{9}}
\end{align*}$$

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{-\frac {7}{9}}$.

This problem mainly tests the understanding of the cofunction identities and the double angle formula for cosine. It also requires recognizing the complementary angle relationship between $\cos ( \frac {π}{3}-α)$ and $\sin ( \frac {π}{6}+α)$. It is a medium-difficulty problem.","Step 1: First, we notice that $\cos ( \frac {π}{3}-α)= \sin ( \frac {π}{6}+α)= \frac {1}{3}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine double angle formula, $\cos (2θ)= 2\cos^2(θ) - 1$, we can rewrite $\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α)$ as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α) &= 2\cos^2( \frac {π}{3}-α) - 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{3}\right)^2 - 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{9}\right) - 1 \\
&= -\frac {7}{9}
\end{align*}$$

Step 3: Thus, the answer is $-\frac {7}{9}$.","Step 1: First, we notice that $\cos ( \frac {π}{3}-α)= \sin ( \frac {π}{6}+α)= \frac {1}{3}$.

Step 2: Using the cosine double angle formula, $\cos (2θ)= 2\cos^2(θ) - 1$, we can rewrite $\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α)$ as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
\cos ( \frac {2π}{3}-2α) &= 2\cos^2( \frac {π}{3}-α) + 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{3}\right)^2 + 1 \\
&= 2\left(\frac {1}{9}\right) + 1 \\
&= \frac {11}{9}
\end{align*}$$",2,Arithmetic sign error,"In Step 2, the arithmetic sign error was introduced by using a plus sign instead of a minus sign in the cosine double angle formula. This mistake led to an incorrect calculation of the cosine value.","
