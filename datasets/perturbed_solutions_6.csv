0,"Given the functions $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$.
1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.","<step>
Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain of the individual logarithmic functions.
</step>

<step>
The domain of a logarithmic function $\log_a(x)$ requires $x > 0$. So, for $\log_a(1+x)$, we need $1+x > 0$, and for $\log_a(1-x)$, we need $1-x > 0$. Solving these inequalities gives us $-1 < x < 1$, which is the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
</step>

<step>
Now, let's determine the symmetry of the function $f(x) - g(x)$. Since the domain $(-1, 1)$ is symmetric about the origin, we can conclude that $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function. To prove this, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then, $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$.
</step>

<step>
Next, we'll find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we can deduce that $f(x) > g(x)$. This implies that $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. We'll consider two cases depending on the value of $a$.
</step>

<step>
Case 1: If $a > 1$, we have the following system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
Simplifying the second inequality, we get $x > 0$. Combining this with the first inequality, we find that $0 < x < 1$.
</step>

<step>
Case 2: If $0 < a < 1$, the system of inequalities becomes:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
Simplifying the second inequality gives us $x < 0$. Together with the first inequality, we conclude that $-1 < x < 0$.
</step>

<step>
In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set is $(-1, 0)$.

#### Part 1: Finding $a$ and $b$

**Given Equations:**

1. $1^{2}+2^{2}-3^{2}=1\times a-b$
2. $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$
3. $3^{2}+4^{2}-5^{2}=3\times 1-b$
4. $4^{2}+5^{2}-6^{2}=4\times 2-b$

**For $a$:**

From the pattern, we observe that the coefficient of $a$ in the first equation is $1$. The left side of the equation simplifies to $1+4-9=-4$. Therefore, we have:

$-4 = 1 \times a - b$

Given that $b$ is a constant across all equations, we can deduce the value of $a$ by comparing the structure of the equations. The first part of the right side of the equation is the product of the index and the number $2$ less than the index. Thus, for the first equation, it should be $1 \times (-1) = -1$. Hence,

$a = -1$

**For $b$:**

From the second equation $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$, we calculate the left side:

$4 + 9 - 16 = -3$

This gives us:

$-3 = 2 \times 0 - b$

Solving for $b$, we find:

$b = 3$

Therefore, the values are:

$a = \boxed{-1}$, $b = \boxed{3}$

#### Part 2: Conjecture for the $n$th Equation and Proof

**Conjecture:**

The $n$th equation can be represented as:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

**Proof:**

**Left Side:**

Starting with the left side of the conjectured equation:

\begin{align*}
n^{2}+(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2} &= n^{2}+(n^{2}+2n+1)-(n^{2}+4n+4) \\
&= n^{2}+n^{2}+2n+1-n^{2}-4n-4 \\
&= n^{2}-2n-3
\end{align*}

**Right Side:**

For the right side of the conjectured equation:

$n\left(n-2\right)-3 = n^{2}-2n-3$

Since the left side equals the right side, we have proven that:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

In summary, only $④$ is correct.

Hence, the answer is: $\boxed{④}$.

$①$ From the set $A={y|y=x-1}=R$, $B={y|y=x^{2}-1}=[-1,+∞)$, we can directly obtain $A∩B=[-1,+∞)$, and then determine whether it is correct or not;

$②$ From $ \begin{cases} x-3 \geqslant 0 \\ 2-x \geqslant 0 \end{cases}$, we solve for $x∈∅$, and then determine whether it is correct or not;

$③$ From $ \begin{cases} 1-x^{2} \geqslant 0 \\ |3-x| \neq 3 \end{cases}$, we solve for $-1 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$, and $x \neq 0$, we know that the domain of the function is symmetric about the origin $(.)$. Transform it into $y= \dfrac { \sqrt {1-x^{2}}}{x}=f(x)$, and satisfy $f(-x)=-f(x)$, then determine its odd and even properties;

$④$ Utilize the given information to obtain: $x_{1}+x_{2}=2×(- \dfrac {b}{2a})=- \dfrac {b}{a}.$. Calculate $f(x_{1}+x_{2})=f(- \dfrac {b}{a})$, and then determine whether it is correct or not.

This question tests the properties of functions, set operations, and simple logical judgment methods. It tests spatial imagination and reasoning abilities and is a moderately difficult question.","<step>

$②$ From $ \begin{cases} x-3 \geqslant 0 \\ 2-x \geqslant 0 \end{cases}$, we solve for $x∈∅$, therefore $y= \sqrt {x-3}+ \sqrt {2-x}$ is not a function expression, hence it is incorrect.

$③$ From $ \begin{cases} 1-x^{2} \geqslant 0 \\ |3-x| \neq 3 \end{cases}$, we solve for $-1 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$, and $x \neq 0$, thus the domain of the function is ${x|-1 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$, and $x \neq 0}$. The function is symmetric about the origin $(.∴y= \dfrac { \sqrt {1-x^{2}}}{3-|3-x|}= \dfrac { \sqrt {1-x^{2}}}{x}=f(x))$, and satisfies $f(-x)=-f(x)$, therefore it is an odd function, hence it is incorrect.

$④$ Given the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c(a≠ 0)$, if $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})(x_{1}≠ x_{2})$, then $x_{1}+x_{2}=2×(- \dfrac {b}{2a})=- \dfrac {b}{a}.∴f(x_{1}+x_{2})=f(- \dfrac {b}{a})=a×(- \dfrac {b}{a})^{2}+b×(- \dfrac {b}{a})+c=c$, therefore it is correct. In summary, only $④$ is correct. Hence, the answer is: $\boxed{④}$.
