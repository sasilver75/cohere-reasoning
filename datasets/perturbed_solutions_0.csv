1,"Given the functions $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$.
1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.","<step>
Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need to consider the domain of the individual logarithmic functions.
</step>

<step>
The domain of $\log_a(1+x)$ is given by $1+x > 0$, and the domain of $\log_a(1-x)$ is given by $1-x > 0$. Solving these inequalities, we find that $-1 < x < 1$. Therefore, the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.
</step>

<step>
Now, let's determine the symmetry of the function $f(x) - g(x)$. Since the domain $(-1, 1)$ is symmetric about the origin, we can define a new function $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Evaluating $F(-x)$, we get $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. This shows that $F(x)$ is an odd function, and consequently, $f(x) - g(x)$ is also an odd function.
</step>

<step>
Next, we consider the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, which is equivalent to $f(x) > g(x)$. This implies that $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. To find the range of $x$ for which this inequality holds, we need to consider two cases depending on the value of $a$.
</step>

<step>
Case 1: If $a > 1$, we have the following system of inequalities:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
Simplifying the second inequality, we get $x > 0$. Combining this with the first inequality, we find that $0 < x < 1$.
</step>

<step>
Case 2: If $0 < a < 1$, the system of inequalities becomes:
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
Simplifying the second inequality gives us $x < 0$. Together with the first inequality, we conclude that $-1 < x < 0$.
</step>

<step>
In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set is $(-1, 0)$.

#### Part 1: Finding $a$ and $b$

**Given Equations:**

1. $1^{2}+2^{2}-3^{2}=1\times a-b$
2. $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$
3. $3^{2}+4^{2}-5^{2}=3\times 1-b$
4. $4^{2}+5^{2}-6^{2}=4\times 2-b$

**For $a$:**

From the pattern, we observe that the coefficient of $a$ in the first equation is $1$. The left side of the equation simplifies to $1+4-9=-4$. Therefore, we have:

$-4 = 1 \times a - b$

Given that $b$ is a constant across all equations, we can deduce the value of $a$ by comparing the structure of the equations. The first part of the right side of the equation is the product of the index and the number $2$ less than the index. Thus, for the first equation, it should be $1 \times (-1) = -1$. Hence,

$a = -1$

**For $b$:**

From the second equation $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$, we calculate the left side:

$4 + 9 - 16 = -3$

This gives us:

$-3 = 2 \times 0 - b$

Solving for $b$, we find:

$b = 3$

Therefore, the values are:

$a = \boxed{-1}$, $b = \boxed{3}$

#### Part 2: Conjecture for the $n$th Equation and Proof

**Conjecture:**

The $n$th equation can be represented as:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

**Proof:**

**Left Side:**

Starting with the left side of the conjectured equation:

\begin{align*}
n^{2}+(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2} &= n^{2}+(n^{2}+2n+1)-(n^{2}+4n+4) \\
&= n^{2}+n^{2}+2n+1-n^{2}-4n-4 \\
&= n^{2}-2n-3
\end{align*}

**Right Side:**

For the right side of the conjectured equation:

$n\left(n-2\right)-3 = n^{2}-2n-3$

Since the left side equals the right side, we have proven that:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

2. The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. To find the number of sides (n) of the polygon, we use the formula for the sum of exterior angles: $n \times \text{exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}$. Substituting the exterior angle we found:

we have $f(x) = 1 - \cos 2x - (\cos 2x \cdot \cos \frac{\pi}{3} - \sin 2x \cdot \sin \frac{\pi}{3})$
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$, we can simplify to:

$$
f(x) = 1 - \frac{3}{2}\cos 2x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin 2x

And further, by using the sum-to-product formulas, we can express $f(x)$ as:

$$
f(x) = \sqrt{3}\sin\left(2x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 1
$$

The argument inside the sine function is linear, and the coefficient of $x$ dictates the period of the sine function. Hence, the smallest positive period $T$ of $f(x)$ is given by:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{n \text{ where } n \text{ is the coefficient of x}}

In this case, $n = 2$, so the smallest positive period is:

$$

$$

(Ⅱ) Given that $0 \le x \le \frac{\pi}{2}$, we know that $-\frac{\pi}{3} \le 2x - \frac{\pi}{3} \le \frac{2\pi}{3}$. 

Thus, $\sin\left(2x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \geq \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ because $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ is within the interval where sine is decreasing and $2x - \frac{\pi}{3}$ is non-negative.

$$
f(x) \geq \sqrt{3}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{3}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2}

f(x) = \sqrt{3}\sin\left(2x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 1
$$
</step>

<step>
The argument inside the sine function is linear, and the coefficient of $x$ dictates the period of the sine function. Hence, the smallest positive period $T$ of $f(x)$ is given by:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{n \text{ where } n \text{ is the coefficient of x}}
$$
</step>

<step>
In this case, $n = 2$, so the smallest positive period is:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi \quad \boxed{T = \pi}

(Ⅱ) Given that $0 \le x \le \frac{\pi}{2}$, we know that $-\frac{\pi}{3} \le 2x - \frac{\pi}{3} \le \frac{2\pi}{3}$.
</step>

<step>
Thus, $\sin\left(2x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \geq \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ because $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ is within the interval where sine is decreasing and $2x - \frac{\pi}{3}$ is non-negative.
</step>

<step>
Substitute this bound into the expression for $f(x)$:

$$
f(x) \geq \sqrt{3}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 1 = -\frac{3}{2} + 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
$$
</step>

<step>
Therefore, we have proven that for $x \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, $f(x) \geq -\frac{1}{2}$, as required. So:

$$
\boxed{f(x) \geq -\frac{1}{2}}
$$
</step>","(Ⅰ) Since $f(x) = 2\sin^2x - \cos(2x + \frac{\pi}{3})$we have $f(x) = 1 - \cos 2x - (\cos 2x \cdot \cos \frac{\pi}{3} - \sin 2x \cdot \sin \frac{\pi}{3})$.Using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$, we can simplify to:$$f(x) = 1 - \cos 2x - \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}$$",2,Misapplied formula,"The formula for $\sin^2x$ was incorrectly applied, resulting in a different expression for $f(x)$."

1. First, we use the cofunction identity, which states that $\sin(\theta) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta)$. Thus, we can rewrite the given equation as $\cos(\frac{\pi}{3} - \alpha) = \frac{1}{3}$.

First, we need to find the line $y = x + m$ that is parallel to $y = x + 2$ and tangent to the curve $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$. Then, we calculate the distance between these two parallel lines to reach the conclusion.

Let's say the line $y = x + m$ is tangent to the curve $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$ at point $P(x_0, y_0)$. From the function $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$, we get the derivative $y' = -2x + \frac{3}{x}$.

Substituting $x_0$ into the function, we obtain $y_0 = -1 + 3\ln 1 = -1$. Thus, the point of tangency is $P(1, -1)$.

#### Part 1: Filling in the Table

- For $\sqrt{0.0004}$, we observe that moving the decimal point two places to the right gives $0.02$.
- For $\sqrt{4}$, moving the decimal point out of the square root gives $2$.
- For $\sqrt{400}$, similarly, moving the decimal point out of the square root gives $20$.

[Step-by-step Solution]

Given the equation $\frac{{x}^{2}-6x+9}{x-1}-\frac{3-x}{{x}^{2}-1}=0$,

First, simplify the equation by applying the perfect square formula and the difference of squares formula:

$\frac{(x-3{)}^{2}}{x-1}-\frac{3-x}{(x+1)(x-1)}=0$.

Next, find a common denominator, which is $(x+1)(x-1)$:

$\frac{(x-3{)}^{2}(x+1)-(3-x)}{(x+1)(x-1)}=0$.

Now, set the numerator equal to $0$ and ensure that the denominator does not equal $0$:

$(x-3{)}^{2}(x+1)-(3-x)=0$ and $x\mathrm{\ne }\pm 1$.

Expand the equation:

$(x-3)(x-3)(x+1)-(3-x)=0$.

Simplify further:

$(x-3)({x}^{2}-2x-2)=0$.

Given that the equation is a sum of a square and an absolute value equal to zero, we recognize that both components must individually equal zero. This is because a square and an absolute value are always non-negative, and their sum can only be zero if each term is zero.

Therefore, $|x-m|+|x+ \frac{1}{m}|\geqslant |(x-m)-(x+ \frac{1}{m})|=|m+ \frac{1}{m}|=m+ \frac{1}{m}$,
</step>

<step>
Equality holds if and only if $(x-m)(x+ \frac{1}{m})\leqslant 0$,
</step>

<step>
Since the equation has real roots, then $m+ \frac{1}{m}\leqslant 2$, but $m+ \frac{1}{m}\geqslant 2$,

48,"Let $f(x)=px- \frac {p}{x}-2\ln x$.  
(I) If $f(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function within its domain, find the range of values for the real number $p$;  
(II) Let $g(x)= \frac {2e}{x}$, and $p > 0$, if there exists at least one point $x_{0}$ in $[1,e]$ such that $f(x_{0}) > g(x_{0})$ holds, find the range of values for the real number $p$.","Solution:  
(I) From $f(x)=px- \frac {p}{x}-2\ln x$,  
we get $f^{′}(x)=p+ \frac {p}{x^{2}}- \frac {2}{x}= \frac {px^{2}-2x+p}{x^{2}}$.  
To make $f(x)$ a monotonically increasing function in its domain $(0,+\infty)$, we need $f′(x)\geqslant 0$,  
i.e., $px^{2}-2x+p\geqslant 0$ holds true in $(0,+\infty)$,  
thus $P\geqslant 1$.  
(II) Solution 1: $g(x)= \frac {2e}{x}$ is a decreasing function in $[1,e]$,  
so $\min[g(x)]=g(e)=2$, $\max[g(x)]=g(1)=2e$, i.e., $g(x)\in[2,2e]$.  
When $0 < p < 1$, from $x\in[1,e]$, we get $x- \frac {1}{x}\geqslant 0$,  
thus $f(x)=p(x- \frac {1}{x})-2\ln x < x- \frac {1}{x}-2\ln x < 2$, which is not in line with the problem statement.  
When $P\geqslant 1$, from (I) we know $f(x)$ is continuously increasing in $[1,e]$, $f(1)=0 < 2$, and since $g(x)$ is a decreasing function in $[1,e]$,  
therefore, the original proposition is equivalent to $\max[f(x)] > \min[g(x)]=2$, $x\in[1,e]$,  
from $\max[f(x)]=f(e)=p(e- \frac {1}{e})-2\ln e > 2$, we solve $p > \frac {4e}{e^{2}-1}$,  
thus, the range of values for $p$ is $\boxed{\left( \frac {4e}{e^{2}-1},+\infty\right)}$.  
Solution 2: The original proposition is equivalent to $f(x)-g(x) > 0$ having a solution in $[1,e)$,  
let $F(x)=f(x)-g(x)=px- \frac {p}{x}-2\ln x- \frac {2e}{x}$,  
since $F^{′}(x)=p+ \frac {p}{x^{2}}- \frac {2}{x}+ \frac {2e}{x^{2}}$  
$= \frac {px^{2}+p+2(e-x)}{x^{2}} > 0$,  
thus $F(x)$ is an increasing function,  
therefore, $\max[F(x)]=F(e) > 0$, we solve $p > \frac {4e}{e^{2}-1}$,  
thus, the range of values for $p$ is $\boxed{\left( \frac {4e}{e^{2}-1},+\infty\right)}$.","<step>
