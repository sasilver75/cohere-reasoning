1,"Given the functions $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$.
1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.","Step 1: Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need $1+x > 0$ and $1-x > 0$. Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

Step 2: Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

Step 3: From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then we have $-1 < x < 1$ and $1+x > 1-x$, which simplifies to $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then we have $-1 < x < 1$ and $1+x < 1-x$, which simplifies to $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set is $(-1, 0)$.

Step 4: The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.

Step 2: Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x) = F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an even function.",2,Algebraic manipulation error,"In Step 2, the algebraic manipulation error occurs when simplifying the expression for $F(-x)$. The correct simplification should be $F(-x) = -F(x)$, indicating an odd function. However, the perturbed step incorrectly states that $F(-x) = F(x)$, implying an even function. This mistake arises from not properly distributing the negative sign in the logarithm's argument."

$-4 = 1 \times a - b$

Given that $b$ is a constant across all equations, we can deduce the value of $a$ by comparing the structure of the equations.

$(1)$ According to the problem, $f'(x)=(2ax+1)e^{-x}-(ax^2+x+a)e^{-x}=-e^{-x}[ax^2+(1-2a)x+a-1]$

$=-e^{-x}(x-1)(ax+1-a)$,

$(i)$ When $a=0$, $f'(x)=-e^{-x}(x-1)$,

Let $f'(x) > 0$, we get $x < 1$; Let $f'(x) < 0$, we get $x > 1$,

Thus, $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-\infty,1)$ and decreasing on $(1,+\infty)$,

So, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(1)= \frac{1}{e}\neq \frac{3}{e}$, which does not meet the condition,

And further, by using the sum-to-product formulas, we can express $f(x)$ as:

$$

First, we need to find the line $y = x + m$ that is parallel to $y = x + 2$ and tangent to the curve $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$. Then, we calculate the distance between these two parallel lines to reach the conclusion.

Let's say the line $y = x + m$ is tangent to the curve $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$ at point $P(x_0, y_0)$. From the function $y = -x^2 + 3\ln x$, we get the derivative $y' = -2x + \frac{3}{x}$.

Since the slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the point of tangency, we have $-2x_0 + \frac{3}{x_0} = 1$. Considering $x_0 > 0$, we solve for $x_0$ and get $x_0 = 1$.

Substituting $x_0$ into the function, we obtain $y_0 = -1 + 3\ln 1 = -1$. Thus, the point of tangency is $P(1, -1)$.

Using the point-slope form of a line, we substitute $x_0$, $y_0$, and the slope $m = 1$ into the equation and solve for $m$. We get $-1 = 1 + m$, which gives us $m = -2$.

The distance $d$ between two parallel lines $y = x + 2$ and $y = x - 2$ is calculated using the formula $d = \frac{|m_1 - m_2|}{\sqrt{(m_1 - m_2)^2 + 1}}$. In this case, $m_1 = m_2 = 1$, so the formula simplifies to $d = 2\sqrt{2}$.

This problem involves solving a rational equation, and proficiency in the rules of operations is essential. The original equation can be simplified using the perfect square formula and the difference of squares formula. Then, find a common denominator for the rational equation and set the numerator equal to $0$ while ensuring that the denominator does not equal $0$. This process will allow you to determine the number of solutions to the rational equation.

[Step-by-step Solution]

Given the equation $\frac{{x}^{2}-6x+9}{x-1}-\frac{3-x}{{x}^{2}-1}=0$,

First, simplify the equation by applying the perfect square formula and the difference of squares formula:

$\frac{(x-3{)}^{2}}{x-1}-\frac{3-x}{(x+1)(x-1)}=0$.

Next, find a common denominator, which is $(x+1)(x-1)$:

$\frac{(x-3{)}^{2}(x+1)-(3-x)}{(x+1)(x-1)}=0$.

Now, set the numerator equal to $0$ and ensure that the denominator does not equal $0$:

$(x-3{)}^{2}(x+1)-(3-x)=0$ and $x\mathrm{\ne }\pm 1$.

Expand the equation:

$(x-3)(x-3)(x+1)-(3-x)=0$.

Simplify further:

$(x-3)({x}^{2}-2x-2)=0$.

Now, set each factor equal to $0$ and solve for $x$:

Given that the equation is a sum of a square and an absolute value equal to zero, we recognize that both components must individually equal zero. This is because a square and an absolute value are always non-negative, and their sum can only be zero if each term is zero.

Step 2: Solve the squared term

For option D, $y=f(x)=sin (2x- \frac {π}{6})$,
$f( \frac {π}{3})=sin (2× \frac {π}{3}- \frac {π}{6})=sin \frac {π}{2}=1≠ 0$, hence D is incorrect and can be eliminated.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{C}$.
By using the period formula, options A and B can be eliminated. Then, by using the property ""the graph is symmetrical about the point $( \frac {π}{3},0)$"", the answer can be obtained.
This question tests the periodicity and calculation methods of trigonometric functions, as well as the symmetry of the cosine function. It is a moderately difficult question.","Step 1: Since the period of $y=sin ( \frac {x}{2}+ \frac {π}{6})$ is $T= \frac {2π}{ \frac {1}{2}}=4π$, option A can be eliminated.

Step 2: Similarly, option B can be eliminated.

Step 3: For option C, $y=f(x)=cos (2x- \frac {π}{6})$, $f( \frac {π}{3})=cos (2× \frac {π}{3}- \frac {π}{6})=cos \frac {π}{2}=0$, Thus, the graph of $f(x)=cos (2x- \frac {π}{6})$ is symmetrical about the point $( \frac {π}{3},0)$, hence C is the correct answer.

Step 4: For option D, $y=f(x)=sin (2x- \frac {π}{6})$, $f( \frac {π}{3})=sin (2× \frac {π}{3}- \frac {π}{6})=sin \frac {π}{2}=1≠ 0$, hence D is incorrect and can be eliminated.

Step 5: Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{C}$.

Step 6: By using the period formula, options A and B can be eliminated. Then, by using the property ""the graph is symmetrical about the point $( \frac {π}{3},0)$"", the answer can be obtained.

Step 7: This question tests the periodicity and calculation methods of trigonometric functions, as well as the symmetry of the cosine function. It is a moderately difficult question.","Step 1: Since the period of $y=sin ( \frac {x}{2}+ \frac {π}{6})$ is $T= \frac {2π}{ \frac {1}{2}}=4π$, option A can be eliminated. Step 2: For option B, the period is $T= \frac {2π}{2}=π$, which is the smallest positive period among the given options. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",2,Misapplied formula,"In Step 2, the formula for the period of a trigonometric function was misapplied. The correct formula for the period of $y=cos (2x- \frac {π}{3})$ is $T= \frac {2π}{2}=π$, not $T= \frac {2π}{2}=2π$. This mistake led to the incorrect conclusion that option B has the smallest positive period."

(1) Find $A\cap B$ and $A\cup(\lnot_{U}B)$;
(2) If $B\cap C=C$, find the range of values for $a$.","(1) Since $A=\{x\mid 1\leqslant x\leqslant 3\}$ and $B=\{x\mid 2 < x < 4\}$,
we have $\lnot_{U}B=\{x\mid x\leqslant 2 \text{ or } x\geqslant 4\}$.
Therefore, $A\cap B=\{x\mid 2 < x\leqslant 3\}$ and $A\cup(\lnot_{U}B)=\{x\mid x\leqslant 3 \text{ or } x\geqslant 4\}$.

Given that $B=\{x\mid 2 < x < 4\}$ and $C=\{x\mid a\leqslant x\leqslant a+1\}$,
we have $2 < a$ and $a+1 < 4$, which implies $2 < a < 3$.

So, the final answer for (1) is $A\cap B=\boxed{\{x\mid 2 < x\leqslant 3\}}$ and $A\cup(\lnot_{U}B)=\boxed{\{x\mid x\leqslant 3 \text{ or } x\geqslant 4\}}$,
