       "'Step 1: The distance $d$ between the center of the circle $C(2,2)$ and the line $l$: $x+y=1$ is $d= \\\\frac{|2+2-1|}{ \\\\sqrt{2}}= \\\\frac{3}{ \\\\sqrt{2}} > 1$, hence the line $l$ and the circle $C$ are separate.\\n\\nStep 2: Let the coordinates of $P$ be $(x,y)$, then $P$ is any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.\\n\\nStep 3: Let the coordinates of $Q$ be $(a,1-a)$, then $Q$ is any point on the line $l$: $x+y=1$.\\n\\nStep 4: Thus, $\\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}=(x+a,y+1-a)$, and $| \\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}|= \\\\sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+(y+1-a)^{2}}$, which represents the distance from the point $(-a,a-1)$ to any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.\\n\\nStep 5: Let the distance between the point $(-a,a-1)$ and the center of the circle $C(2,2)$ be $d$, then the minimum value of $| \\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1$.\\n\\nStep 6: We have $d= \\\\sqrt{(-a-2)^{2}+(a-1-2)^{2}}= \\\\sqrt{2a^{2}-2a+13}= \\\\sqrt{2(a- \\\\frac{1}{2})^{2}+ \\\\frac{25}{2}}$,\\n\\nStep 7: When $a= \\\\frac{1}{2}$, $d$ is minimum and equals to $ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{25}{2}}$, hence the minimum value of $| \\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1= \\\\frac{5 \\\\sqrt{2}}{2}-1= \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{5 \\\\sqrt{2}-2}{2}}$.\\n\\nStep 8: Firstly, determine that the line $l$: $x+y=1$ and the circle $C$ are separate. Then, set the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$ to obtain the coordinates of $\\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}$. The analytical expression of $| \\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}|$ can be derived, and its minimum value can be found using the geometric meaning of $| \\\\overrightarrow{OP}+ \\\\overrightarrow{OQ}|$ and the properties of quadratic functions.\\n\\nStep 9: This problem primarily tests the understanding of the relationship between a line and a circle, the calculation of the magnitude of a vector, and the formula for the distance between two points, as well as the properties of quadratic functions. It is of moderate difficulty.'"
